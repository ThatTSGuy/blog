# About Us

### *Personal finance everyone can understand!*

Gym Class Finance is a personal finance media company focused on creating value through blogging, our YouTube Channel, and financial coaching.

Founded by Sean Lehman, we aim to provide value by creating trusted financial content and resources to help our audience crush debt, live on a budget, begin investing and start a side hustle.

We do this through our free social media content, articles, suggested resources, one-on-one financial coaching calls and formation of a supportive like-minded community!

### Our Mission

Our mission is to provide value and support to our community in a fun, engaging, and relatable way.
There’s a lot of “noise” in the personal finance world. We want to simplify investing, debt reduction, budgeting and side hustles in a way that **everyone** understands, no matter your income.

*The financial education you wish you had in high school.*
