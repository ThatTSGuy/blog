Creating and maintaining a budget is a skill that not many people like to talk about or actually follow
through with and manage. Interestingly enough though, according to a 2020 survey from Debt.com
where they polled 1,000 individuals, they found that 80% of people do actually budget. That number
was 68% from their 2019 survey. Finally, 88% of those budgeters said it got them — or kept them — out
of debt.

This leads us to believe that Americans are becoming wise when it comes to managing finances,
eliminating debt and building wealth. Budgeting, whether everyone wants to believe it or not, is an
important part of your life if you want to be successful and in balance with your finances.

### Definition of a Budget {#definition-of-a-budget}

Put simply, a budget is a plan for how you spend your money. It is giving every dollar of income you
make an assignment or job. A budget keeps you in charge of the management of your money.

Typically, living on a budget means starting before the month begins and giving your money a home or a
budget category. This is called zero-based budgeting, where you take your income minus your expenses
which should ultimately equal zero. When you give every dollar a task, you’ll be surprised what you can
do. A budget does not limit you, it gives you freedom.

### Defining Income and Expenses {#defining-income-and-expenses}

Before you can get your budget off and running, you need to distinguish between the different types of
income and expenses you have. Remember, when creating your budget, you take income minus your
expenses.

- ### Income

    First, let’s talk income. Your net income is the amount of money you take home after taxes. Not all
    income is the same. You can receive income from a variety of sources.

    - #### Fixed Income

        Fixed income is the set salary amount of money you earn by the end of the month for your
        services or work. Fixed income could include business income, fixed monthly salary, fixed
        investment, or any other fixed or set profit you receive.

    - #### Variable Income

        Variable income varies and depends on factors revolved around your performance. It
        includes bonuses, returns from investments, profit from side hustles, interest income, tips,
        etc. Since you can’t be sure of how much you’ll make in bonus, this will go into the variable
        income column.

Add up all of your sources of income to determine your total net income for the month. This is the first
step when creating a budget.

- ### Expenses

    Next, it is time to deal with your expenses or what you spend your money on each month. Expenses can
    be broken down into three types. There are fixed, variable and discretionary expenses.

    - #### Fixed Expenses

        These are the expenses that need to be paid no matter what. Examples of fixed expenses
        include a mortgage, rent, insurance, set fees among other expenses. These expense are
        uncontrollable. If you do not pay them, you can run into legal issues.

    - #### Variable Expenses

        These are the expenses that you can control. Examples include buying groceries, and
        shopping for clothes among others. Variable expenses can be reduced which is why they
        vary per month.

    - #### Discretionary Expenses

        These are the expenses that are not necessary in your life. Examples may include luxury and
        holiday shopping. In order to afford these expenses, saving for them well in advance is key.
        When creating your budget, breaking down your expenses into the three types will help you manage
        your budget successfully. You will know what you can and can’t afford each month, and make the
        appropriate changes in advance of creating your budget.

### Why You Need a Budget {#why-you-need-a-budget}

It ultimately comes down to spending less than you make. If you can do that, you have successfully lived
on a budget. If you spend more than you make, you have essentially created or added to your debt.
Living on a budget gives you freedom, going into debt by spending more than you make weighs you
down. It creates barriers to your ability to grow your wealth.
Living on a budget gives you full and complete control over your money. Most people living paycheck to
paycheck are not living on a budget. Every month is a guessing game. Living on a budget allows you to
reach your financial goals much sooner.

### Budget Goals {#budget-goals}

Speaking of goals, let’s talk about some goals around budgeting. We have to rewind a bit and think
about before you even start your budget. It is important to think about your long-term money goals.
What are you looking to achieve in the next year, 5 years, ten years or even in retirement. These goals
will greatly impact the choices you make in your budget.

#### Goal Examples:

- Saving $20,000 for a car in the next 24 months
- Saving $10,000 for a European vacation
- Fully funding Roth IRAs for you and your spouse ($13,000 annually)
- Saving to buy a home
- Becoming debt-free in 3 years
- Avoid spending money on shoes

Writing out your goals, will help you decide how much you will put in savings as well as the categories
you would like to spend your hard-earned money on.

### Budgeting Essentials {#budgeting-essentials}

You’ve set your goals and determined your income for the month. Now it is time to ensure that you
have all your budget categories and funds in their proper place. This is the part that is specifically up to
the budgeter, but there are a few categories or funds that you want to make sure you include. Creating
your plan and categories helps you control spending.

There are a variety of viewpoints on how to organize your categories. From there you can create your
smaller sub-categories. Four broad categories below will help guide you and ensure you include funds
that are essential to a proper budget.

- ### Money for your Future

    - #### Emergency Fund

        Do you like security? That is what an emergency fund gives you. Life happens,
        and it can happen quickly! An emergency fund is money you set aside for life’s
        emergencies. You have an unexpected health problem, an appliance goes out,
        your basement springs a leak. How are you going to pay for it? Hopefully, with
        your emergency fund. Set 3-6 months of expenses into a savings account. Your
        emergency fund should be located somewhere you can access quickly and you
        should not touch it unless there is an emergency. Buying the latest Jordan’s is
        not an emergency!

    - #### Retirement Accounts

        Pay yourself first. Before you pay any bills or do any shopping, a portion of your
        earnings should be distributed into your retirement account(s) for your future
        self.
        Time flies so planning for your future is key. You do not want to have to depend
        on your kids or the government to take care of you in retirement.

    - #### Debt Payoff

        No one likes debt. Especially consumer debt, so having a fund specifically meant
        to knock it out is important. If you do not currently have debt, then no need to
        worry about creating this fund. Just make sure you stay out of it. Just so you
        know, this does not include your mortgage if you have one. That’s a separate
        category.

- ### Money for your Essentials / Needs

    Next, think about what is essential or a must to be paid throughout the month. These
    are the things that you need to live your life. Getting your nails done or shopping for
    clothes does not belong here.
    The categories that do belong here are things like mortgage, rent, transportation, food,
    and utilities. These items are often called the four walls of your budget. Keep these
    categories broad, or break them down if needed. For example, Utilities could be broken
    down into water, sewer, electric, gas and trash.
    Protect your four walls.

- ### Money for your Life Goals

    The third broad category for your budget includes funds for your life goals. This includes
    money you are saving besides your retirement account. Maybe you have some mid-
    level goals like saving for a home, home remodel, a business or college.
    It is up to you, but having separate accounts for these savings may help you organize
    your life and budget for these categories of savings.

- ### Money for Leisure / Entertainment / Fun

    Finally, it is time to create categories for your non-essentials or really anything else.
    These funds are for things you choose to splurge on. For example, you may have a
    shopping fund, eating out fund, traveling fund, entertainment fund, hobby fund or
    whatever else you like to do. Have fun with this category, but these funds should be
    budgeted for last.

### 4 Budgeting Methods {#4-budgeting-methods}

Budgeting can be done through a variety of ways. There is not one budgeting method that trumps all.
Each method has its pros and cons and is preferred by varying individuals.

- ### Envelope System

    The envelope system has been around for years. This budgeting method is best for
    individuals who tend to overspend and need discipline in maintaining a budget. Using cash
    is essential to this method because it involves writing your budget categories on envelopes
    and stuffing those envelopes with the specific allotted amount. You cannot go over the
    specific amount that is in each envelope.

- ### Budgeting Apps

    Smartphone apps are a growing trend in regards to creating and maintaining a budget.
    Because most people carry a mobile device everywhere they go, it is easier to track your
    expenses. One major benefit to using budgeting apps is that some apps link to your
    financial / bank accounts to alert you or automatically update your expenses.
    Some apps are free and some cost money for extra features. The most popular apps are
    Mint, You Need a Budget and Every Dollar.

- ### Spreadsheets (Excel or Google Sheets)

    The use of spreadsheets to keep a budget have proven to be a great tool that you can use
    on laptops, desktops or even mobile devices. The customization is a huge reason why
    people like using spreadsheets to budget. There are formulas you can use to quickly and
    efficiently add figures and get updated balances.

- ### Paper / Pencil / Printed Budget Tracker

    This is the more traditional method of tracking your income and expenses within a budget.
    The paper / pencil method of budgeting can be tiring and take a little extra work. It is often
    suggested to buy a specific notebook or printed budget tracker to ease the amount of
    writing you do each month. Depending on how specific you get, you may use this method
    daily or at the end of each week so that you do not get overwhelmed.

### The Simple Budget – 50/30/20 Budget Rule {#the-simple-budget}

If you’re feeling incredibly overwhelmed right now, then starting here might be for you. The 50/30/20
Budget simplifies budgeting and could be a good place to start.

- #### 50% Needs

    It states that half (50%) of your budget should consist of needs. This includes items like:
    - Food
    - Rent
    - Mortgage
    - School Tuition
    - Utilities
    - Transportation
    - Insurance

- #### 30% Wants

    It states that 30% of your budget should consist of wants. This includes items like:
    - Shopping
    - Dining
    - Personal Care
    - Hobbies
    - Subscriptions

- #### 20% Financial Goals / Savings

    It states that 20% of your budget should consist of financial goals or other savings. This includes
    items like:

    - Emergency Fund
    - Savings
    - Debt Repayment
    - Retirement (401k, IRA, pension, etc)

### Budget Consistency {#budget-consistency}

It’s one thing to create a budget, but sticking to it is another. There are a variety of barriers to being
consistent. For example, you may forget to track and record your income and expenses.
However, there are solutions to being inconsistent with your budgeting. First, do not do it alone. This
will typically be a spouse, but could be someone else. Now, you only want one person in control of the
budget, but having accountability is important. Checking in, and planned budget meetings are key.
Making sure everyone in your family is aware and on the same page is also important. If you are
working together toward one common goal, you will be able to save and limit your expenses.
Finally, keep your credit card use to a minimum. Using credit cards are so easy these days, but you can
get much more careless and free with your spending if you just swipe for everything. If you do use a
credit card, limit how many you have or use one card for specific purchases.

### Conclusion (The Cool Down) {#conclusion}

Maintaining a budget may not appear to be important on the surface, but it can be the overwhelming
factor in whether or not you are successful financially or not.
Start small and simple, test different methods out and ask questions to other successful budgeters until
you master it. When your expenses are less than your income, you know you are doing it right!
