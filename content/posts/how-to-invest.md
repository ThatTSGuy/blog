For the longest time, it was thought that you had to be ultra wealthy in order to invest. That was not
the case and certainly is not the case now. The ability to invest in a variety of asset classes has never
been easier, no matter the income you earn.

Before you invest, you need to have a basic understanding of what investing is, what you can invest in,
where you can invest and the strategies involved when investing.
This post will help you discover the basics of investing that anyone can understand as well as a smart
place to start.

### Define Investing {#define-investing}

Before you can invest, it is important to understand why we invest and how investing is defined. Placing
a wager on your favorite team to win or buying a stock, or a piece of a company and trying to sell it the
next day (day trading) are not examples of investing. Investing is the act of allocating capital into
something to create income or gain profits. The type of investment you choose depends on what you
anticipate to gain and how much risk you take. Assuming little risk generally yields lower returns and the
same can be said for assuming higher amounts of risk. The amount of time allocated for the investment
is also key. Long-term investing in general, produces better returns, fighting off inflation.

### Multiple Asset Classes {#multiple-asset-classes}

There are a ton of opportunities available to invest your hard earned money and time into in order to
profit. These opportunities are called assets. Assets are anything that has current or future economic
value. Appreciating assets produce income or cash flow and/or go up in value over time.

Some examples of assets include:

- Stocks / Bonds
- ETFs / Mutual Funds / Index Funds
- Real Estate Including Land
- A Business
- High Yield Savings Accounts / Certificates of Deposit (CD)
- Collectibles / Rare Art / Fine Wine
- Precious Metals / Rare Earth Metals / Jewelry
- Commodities (oil, natural gas, gold, silver, copper, livestock, corn, rice, wheat, coffee, cocoa, and soybeans)
- Cryptocurrency / NFTs
- Digital Assets (Domain Names / Social Media / Metaverse)

### Investing Accounts {#investing-accounts}

Investing accounts come in a variety of shapes and sizes. If your job has an employer-sponsored
retirement plan, almost 100% of the time, employees take part in it. Some require it. This typically
comes in the form of a 401(k) and there are a few different plans, but that is for another article.
Essentially, you want to take advantage of these plans because they almost always have some sort of tax
benefit.
In addition to any 401(k) options or pensions, individual retirement accounts are a great account option.
There is a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA. The traditional option allows you to make ‘pre-tax’
contributions which is best for those expecting to make equal or less income in retirement.
The Roth IRA is best for those that plan on retiring at a higher tax bracket because you will make ‘after-
tax’ contributions. This allows for your contributions to grow tax-free.

### Strategies When Investing {#strategies-when-investing}

If you look up strategies for investing online, you’ll find a lot of “experts” teaching you how to invest.
There are several viable options, but also a ton of options that you want to avoid like the plague. Let’s
first look at the most important strategy which is to have a long-term mindset.

- ### Long-Term

    Investing for the long-term is critical because markets go up and down throughout a year. There can be
    bull markets that seem to never end, but the markets can go bear in an instant. One thing we know for
    sure is that investing over the long-term has proven data to support it. If you take the S&P 500 index
    since its inception in 1926, you find it has produced an average of more than 10% in gains annually.

- ### Dollar-Cost Averaging

    Being a long-term investor is a broad strategy. Within long-term investing, many investors participate in
    what is called dollar-cost averaging. With this strategy, you buy portions of the asset at different price
    points and times. This helps to combat the volatility of the market.
    Suppose you have $10,000 to invest in Amazon stock that is priced at $100 per share. An individual
    might buy $2,500 worth of the stock in month 1. In month 2, they would buy another $2,500 of Amazon
    stock at $75 per share. They would have $5,000 still to invest, but in month one, they were able to to
    buy 25 shares and in month two they were able to buy more than 33 shares for a total of 58 shares. If
    the investor did not take a dollar-cost averaging approach, they would have only ended up with 50
    shares.

- ### Diversification

    Another important strategic approach to investing is diversification. This is putting your money into
    different assets, markets, and economies. For example, you would not want to put all of your capital
    into that Amazon stock that we mentioned above. You would want to invest in an S&amp;P 500 or Total
    Stock Market Fund. If you would really want to diversify you might consider buying assets from the real
    estate market as well as commodities.

- ### Keeping Fees Low

    It does not matter what asset you invest in, keeping your fees low is extremely important. Many
    brokerages and investing platforms offer 0% fees/commissions. You may be surprised what taking 1-2%
    annually off your portfolio will do to it. With time, it ends up being a considerable amount of money.

### The Best Investments for Beginners {#best-investments-for-beginners}

The best advice I’ve ever received is to not invest in something you don’t understand. There was a large
list of assets above that literally anyone can buy with a couple clicks of a button. That does not mean
you should. Keep it simple and invest in something that has an amazing track record over the course of
well over 50 years.
If you are just getting started and have no idea what to do, a good place to start is to invest in index
funds. For example if you buy S&amp;P 500 index funds you are getting more than 500 companies in one
share. That is diversity at its finest. Index funds track a market so if the S&amp;P 500 which has some of the
largest companies in the USA in it, you will be invested in a small portion of those companies with each
share you own. Even further, a total stock market index fund gives even more diversity as it invests in
the entire US stock market which is several thousand companies.

### Conclusion (The Cool Down) {#conclusion}

Starting your investment journey takes time. You need to do your research and at least have a basic
knowledge of the markets and what it is that you are investing in. Investing has never been as easy as it
is now. You can invest as little as $100 right from your phone. Before you start,  create a long-term plan
based on your goals, determining which assets align with your risk tolerance and strategy.
